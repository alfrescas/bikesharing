# Bike Sharing Program Analysis:

## Overview of Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis, is to start a bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. The following analysis will provide stakeholders a visualization using Tableau to see the bike trip analysis. Using Pandas to change the "tripduration" from an integer to a datetime datatype. We will create visualizations to:
   
   1. Show the length of time the bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
   2. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
   3. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
  
 ## Results: 
 Using Tableau to provide the visualizations from the data we converted, I made the first visual, which is _The Check out Times for Users"_ in this visual, I graphed the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders. Graph provided below:
