# Bike Sharing Program Analysis:

## Overview of Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis, is to start a bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. The following analysis will provide stakeholders a visualization using Tableau to see the bike trip analysis. Using Pandas to change the "tripduration" from an integer to a datetime datatype. I will create visualizations to:
   
   1. Show the length of time the bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
   2. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
   3. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

 ## Results: 
 Using Tableau to provide the visualizations from the data I converted, I made the first visual, which is _"The Check out Times for Users"_ in this visual, I graphed the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders. Graph provided below:

 Using that information I then graphed _Check Out Times by Gender_ graph below:

Then, I created a visual to graph the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as a heatmap. Graph of _Trips by Gender_ Below:

## Summary:
The data shows that the gender that the company needs to reach is the female demographic. My suggestions would be that in order to provide a better service, the company would need to provide more marketing towards the female demographic.
